The plan

limit search to papers with search terms in title or abstract (with "[tiab]")
get synonyms of search queries out of database
	construct search like
	(term 1 synonym 1 [tiab] OR term1 synonym2[tiab] OR ...) AND (term2 synonym 1[tiab] OR term2 synonym 2 [tiab] OR ...)
let user verify meaning of acronyms when used as query term
	some sort of scanning the synonym database to see what the likely menaing is
	throws out papers that ahve less than 30% of words in synonym phrase in abstract
Allow user to put in "context keywords"
Synopsis generation??
	first 100 sentences that contain specific query term or its synonyms.
	Highest ranked sentences favor short conclusive sentences
	see paper for weighting scheme.
	15 sentences with highest weight are displayed (processed?)
NLP
	on sentences with both search terms:
	POS analysis
		GENIA corpus +?
	Shallow Parsing to identify verb phrases
	classification of relationships
		interactive vs non-interactive
			interactive = presence of verb phrase between queries
				EXCEPT parallel when queries in different clauses
				no verb phrase but words specifying interaction
				parallel when negative words in verb phrase
		further classified on presence of other words
		direction -see paper (passive voice)
		cooccurence when not in same sentence
Visualization, etc
