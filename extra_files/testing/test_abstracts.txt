[' DAT-CI mice are hyperdopaminergic due to reduced DAT function, and may thus be a good model for studying attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)', ' In summary, reduced DAT function in DAT-CI mice leads to a hyperdopaminergic state, and an ADHD-like phenotype in both strains']
[' The presynaptic, cocaine- and amphetamine (AMPH)-sensitive DA transporter (DAT) constrains DA availability at presynaptic and postsynaptic receptors following vesicular release and is targeted by the most commonly prescribed ADHD therapeutics', ' Using polymorphism discovery approaches with an ADHD cohort, we identified a hDAT (human DAT) coding variant, R615C, located in the distal C terminus of the transporter, a region previously implicated in constitutive and regulated transporter trafficking', ' Together, our studies support a coupling of DAT microdomain localization with transporter regulation and provide evidence of perturbed DAT activity and DA signaling as a risk determinant for ADHD']
[u"BACKGROUND: The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between dopamine transporter (DAT) binding in the striatum in individuals with and without attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attending to the 3'-untranslated region of the gene (3'-UTR) and intron8 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphisms of the DAT (SLC6A3) gene", u" The ADHD status was associated with increased striatal (caudate) DAT binding regardless of 3'-UTR genotype, and 3'-UTR genotype was associated with increased striatal (caudate) DAT binding regardless of ADHD status", u" CONCLUSIONS: The 3'-UTR but not intron8 VNTR genotypes were associated with increased DAT binding in both ADHD patients and healthy control subjects", u" Both ADHD status and the 3'-UTR polymorphism status had an additive effect on DAT binding", u" Our findings suggest that an ADHD risk polymorphism (3'-UTR) of SLC6A3 has functional consequences on central nervous system DAT binding in humans"]
